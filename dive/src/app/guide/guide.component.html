  <div class="subtitle">Vegetables</div>
  <p>When most green vegetables begin to go bad, they start to lose their color or turn yellow. This is often the case
    with broccoli and kale, for example, but may apply to other fresh veggies as well.

    Still, some vegetables, such as celery or onion, can often be salvageable. Make sure you trim off the discolored
    portion and then try soaking it for 10-15 minutes in ice water to refresh it, the Greater Chicago Food Depository
    suggests.</p>
  <div class="subtitle">Fruit</div>
  <p>
    If your fruit has become mushy or grainy, it's probably a sign that you shouldn't eat it, according to the Greater
    Chicago Food Depository. Other warning signs that a fruit has gone bad include extreme discoloring, foul odors, or
    wrinkly skin that's peeling away.
  </p>

<div *ngIf="currentGuide === 'meat'">
  <div class="subtitle">Eggs</div>
  <p>
    If an egg is bad, it floats in fresh, cold water. If an egg is good, it sinks.

    You may have dismissed this tip as nonsense, but there's some solid science behind it, according to the US
    Department of Agriculture.

    While egg shells seem solid, they're actually slightly porous. As an egg ages, a sac of air begins to form inside
    around the inside of the shell. The older it is, the more air becomes trapped inside. Once so much air is inside the
    egg that it floats, chances are it's gone bad. (Of course, an old egg can still be OK to eat, but better safe than
    sorry!) Fresh eggs, on the other hand, will sink to the bottom of a bowl of water.
  </p>
  <div class="subtitle">Fresh meat</div>
  <p>Just because uncooked meat has changed color doesn't mean it's gone bad, as the USDA points out. But if your meat
    has a foul odor, appears slimy, or has a sticky or tacky feel, it's best to toss it.</p>
  <div class="subtitle">Deli</div>
  <p>If sliced deli meat like turkey, ham, or salami has a foul odor, throw it out; the smell typically indicates
    bacteria is growing inside, according to the folks at EatByDate. Also toss it if it has become slimy or hard, or if
    you notice any other change in texture. If you buy your meat fresh from the deli, make sure to eat it within three
    days.</p>

  <div class="subtitle">Fish</div>
  <p>Fish that's spoiled will typically have a slimy flesh with a thick, slippery coating. It'll also start to have an
    intensified fishy smell that is stronger than it was when you first purchased it. Keep in mind that fresh fish
    should be eaten within 36 hours of the time you bought it.</p>
</div>

<div *ngIf="currentGuide === 'dairy'">
  <div class="subtitle">Cheese</div>
  <p>When it comes to cheese, perishability has a lot to do with the amount of moisture it contains.

    Soft cheeses tend to spoil more quickly than hard or aged cheeses; similarly, if you spot mold in a soft cheese, you
    should toss the entire container. If you spot mold on a hard cheese, it's generally safe to cut off the moldy part
    and eat the rest, since the spores likely will not have spread throughout the cheese.

    Another sign that a cheese has gone bad is a smell or taste of spoiled, sour milk. Fresh cheeses should not smell,
    chef Nora Singley writes in her "Cheesemonger" blog for the cooking site The Kitchn.

  </p>
  <div class="subtitle">Milk</div>
  <p>The easiest way to tell if milk has spoiled is by checking for changes in texture or consistency. Chunky or lumpy
    milk is almost assuredly bad, but you can also look out for things like discoloration or an unclean, sour smell,
    which happens when lactic acid in the milk starts producing bacteria.</p>
  <div class="subtitle">Yogurt</div>
  <p>Yogurt can last a surprisingly long time (about one to three weeks) when kept sealed, thanks to its live bacterial
    cultures, which act as a preservative.

    Once those cultures die, however, mold can begin to form. Look for a larger-than-normal amount of liquid on the
    surface (don't worry, Greek yogurt is especially prone to some, but if there's more than usual that's a warning
    sign), a curdling texture near the bottom, and any sign of mold. These indicate the entire product has probably gone
    bad, say the folks at StillTasty.</p>
</div>

<div *ngIf="currentGuide === 'baked'">
  <div class="subtitle">Bread</div>
  <p>
    If you spot mold on one slice of bread, it's not safe to eat another slice â€” even if there's no visible mold on the
    rest of the loaf. Toss it.

    Because bread is porous, mold can spread easily throughout the loaf, so while a piece might look safe to eat, it
    could contain tiny mold spores.

    If a bread has become hard and dry but has no mold, it can probably still be used as bread crumbs or croutons, since
    mold needs moisture to grow.
